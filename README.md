# Credit_card_Default_Prediction
This repository contains a Credit Card Default prediction model built using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of historical credit card transactions and customer information to predict the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payments.

## Features
### Random Forest Model: 
The prediction model is based on the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.

### Dataset:
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset consisting of various features such as customer demographics, credit card usage patterns, payment history, and other relevant factors that may influence credit card default.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure optimal performance of the model.

### Feature Selection: 
The model utilizes feature selection techniques to identify the most important features contributing to the prediction, improving the model's accuracy and interpretability.

### Evaluation Metrics: 
The model's performance is evaluated using commonly used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its effectiveness in predicting credit card default.
